node structure 

typedef struct node{
	int data; //can be easily ported to generic using void* and datasize parameter
	int next_shmid; 
}node;

during initialization, next_shmid will be -1, but will have a proper value if next node is given

as shmid given by OS startes from 0 and increses, shmid itslef can be seen as index of a semaphore set, we make a huge semaphore set (will be used as mutex only) with last elem defining if the there exist a linked list or not (will be used for deallocating the semaphore set)

every node is made atomic using the semaphore set

for deletion, we do similar method as the general LL delete, but we use two semaphores simultaneously
